# Printable BST

Project was created as part of test for work interview in tinkoff. 

SimpleBst is an unbalanced Binary Search Tree. 

## Time complexity

- add() and search() methods run in approximately O(logN) time for random input and in O(N) in worst case.
- print() method runs in O(N*logN) on random input and O(N^2) in worst case.

## Space complexity

- add() and search() methods run with O(1) space
- print() runs with O(N*logN) space on random input and O(N^2) in worst case

## Posibble improvements

Red-black tree realization of BST interface could be added to reduce worst-case time and space complexity.
